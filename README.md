# NSLKDD Exploratory Data Analysis

## Introduction üé©

This repository is an exploratory data analysis of the NSL-KDD Dataset.
I wrote an article on my website on my findings which can be found [here](https://gerrysaporito.com/articles/technology).

## Description üìù

This repository is a deep dive of the NSL-KDD dataset. Most of the general findings can be found in an [article](https://gerrysaporito.com/articles/technology) I wrote on my website

### Learning Experience üìö

This project gave me a chance to work with new technologies including:

- [Python](https://www.gerrysaporito.com/)
- [Pandas](https://gerrysaporito.com)
- [Anaconda](https://gerrysaporito.com/) (Jupyter Notebooks)

Although I learned a lot by experiencing these common artificial intelligence related technologies, this project taught me much more than just how to use new technologies. This project forced me to adjust the way I think and approach problems. Data Analysis is a very broad term and there are many different approaches to finding information related to it. That's why its so important to clearly understand the goal of the data analysis and what you want to get out of it.

The reason I performed a data analysis on the NSLKDD dataset was because my team at Deloitte wanted to use it in a Generative Adversarial Network (deep learning neural networks) and I was tasked with optimizing the preprocessing to reduce total train time.

Given this task, I deduced a goal to one sentence: "I want to find and remove the redundancies in this dataset to optimize the network's training and testing time."

## Roadmap üó∫

This analysis is only a high level analysis, providing breakdowns of categories and counts for each dataset. In the future, I could see heatmap matrices playing a large role in finding the relationship between individual features which could be useful for isolating or "zoning in" on certain attack types.

To be honest, there are a lot of roads this could go down because the term "data analysis" is a very broad concept. I only provided one example of how the data analysis could be perfomred moving forward because I think it's up to the individual to perform an analysis depending on their needs or goals.
